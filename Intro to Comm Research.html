  <h2>Course Description</h2>

  <h2>My Teacher's Bio</h2>
  <p>Dr. Haenschen is an expert in Data Journalism, Digital Media Influence and Political participation. This comes through in her teaching. She uses great examples that stem from her own research as well as her experience in general. She really focuses on voter turnout and other topics that pertain to voting and politics. I am helping her with recent research she is conducting that has to do with political groups on Facebook and ther affiliation along with media outlets on Facebook and if they are left leaning, center or right leaning.</p>
  <h2>My Opinion</h2>
  <p>I enjoy this class. I have learned a lot of valuable skills. The class has given me real life experiences that laid a foundation of skills that I can use to learn more later whether it's in higher level classes or in an internship or job setting. My favorite part of the class is when I did the in-depth interview. I interviewed one of my other professors, Dr. Mackay, about the state of the media. That's another thing I really like about this class, she lets us pick topics we're interested in or that apply to our career interests so we are learning with material we enjoy.</p>
