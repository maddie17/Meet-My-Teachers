  <h1>Intro to Sociology</h1>
  <h2>Dr. Williams</h2>
  <h2>Course Description</h2>
  <p>In this class, we discussed topics such as stratification, class, gender, health, race, family, deviance and poverty. The class was meant to inform students how to think in a sociological way.</p>
  <h2>My Teacher's Bio</h2>
  <p>Dr. Williams is an expert on Family Relationships. More specifically, according to the Virginia Tech website, she focuses non-marital childbearing and how it influences parental bonds and relationships as well as extended family involvement and child wellbeing in general.</p>
  <h2>My Opinion</h2>
  <p> My favorite topic we discussed is health. I learned a lot about healthcare and how the government and the society we've created helps and hinders people in terms of health care. At the end of the day though, we can't talk about any of the topics without discussing the others.</p>
  <p> Sociology has taught me one major key concept. It's not fair to judge someone right off the bat. So many factors go into what makes people do what they do. Instead of being quick to judge someone, I now try to acknowledge other factors that might be contributing to the aspect of the person I'm quickly judging.</p>
  <p>To further explain this concept, I will offer the example of obesity. People quickly assume overweight people just need to exercise and eat healthier. In reality, it's not always that simple. Factors such as their socioeconomic status and their neighborhood play crucial roles in their weight. For instance, if the person is of a low socioeconomic status, they probably live in a lower income neighborhood. Grocery stores know lower income people won't be able to afford the majority of what they sell in their stores so they don't have Gucci Krogers in lower income neighborhoods. Instead, these neighborhoods have convenience stores that sell the cheaper, unhealthier foods. There likely aren't Farmer's Markets in these areas and even if there were, the likelihood of the people being able to afford items from the market would be slim.</p>
