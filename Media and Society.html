  <h1>Media and Society</h1>
  <h2>Dr. Mackay</h2>

  <h2>Course Description</h2>
  <p>In this class, we talked about how the media and society influence each other. We talked about topics ranging from newspapers to music to books to television and movies to radio. My favorite lectures by far were the newspaper and book lectures. Print journalism facinates me so learning about the history of newspapers reasserted the importance of the media that I believe we, as society, often times forget. I loved the book lecture because I love to read and learning about the book publishing industry showed me a new interest of mine in terms of a possible career.</p>
  <h2>My Teacher's Bio</h2>
  <p>Dr. Mackay is an expert in Journalism Ethics. She is also in expert in Technology in Journalism and Reporting. She worked in television and print journalism in her career. In terms of research, her current research pertains to political cartoons. She has written numerous articles and has contributed to books and textbooks.</p>
  <h2>My Opinion</h2>
  <p>Dr. Mackay has been one of my favorite professors. I was excited the first day of class to hear about her passion for journalism. She has played a large part in this being my favorite class of the semester. I enjoyed meeting with her outside of class to talk more about journalism. She also made lectures engaging and asks very engaging questions that made me think deeper about the media and its relationship with society.</p>
  <p>Dr. Mackay played a significant role in this being my favorite class of the semester and arguably of my first year and a half of college. I have found this class to be extremely beneficial and informative. I feel more prepared for higher level classes and a journalism career. The class has confirmed my passion for journalism as well as opened my eyes to the book publishing industry.</p>
