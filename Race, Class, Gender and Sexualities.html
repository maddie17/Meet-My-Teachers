  <h2>Course Description</h2>
  <p>In this class, we talked about how race, class, gender and sexuality interact with eachother to form a person's identity. We also talked about how the aspects of the person's identity impact their experience of the world. What I mean by this is who is privileged and who is not. Some of the topics we talked about include health, mass incarcination, racism in sports and modern day segregation taking the view point of education. We also read two books: Between the World and Me and The Hate U Give. These books were eye opening in so many ways.</p>
  <h2>My Teacher's Bio</h2>
  <p>Dr. Brown is an expert in Race/Ethnicity, Gender/Sexuality, Sociology of Sport, Food Studies and Black Feminism according to the Virginia Tech website. She also has a number of articles published as well. This came through in her teaching. We focused more on the lectures that pertained to her area of focus.</p>
  <h2>My Opinion</h2>
  <p>My favorite part of the class was reading the two books I listed perviously. I loved the books and felt I learned so much. Between the World and Me was a letter from the author to his son and The Hate U Give is a book about a teenage girl is in the car when her best friend gets shot by a police officer. I am someone who will not experience what it is like to have a black body and these books helped me grasp the reality of racism that occurs in America today. This is a class that anyone and everyone should take. It taught me a lot about compassion because there are a lot more factors that go into peoples' actions than what meets the eye and it's important to consider these.</p>
