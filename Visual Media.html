  <h2>Course Description</h2>
  <p>In this class, we learned about multiple programs, skills and pieces of technology that we will need to know how to use in our future careers. We learned how to use different Adobe Cloud programs such as InDesign, Photoshop and Premire. We also learned about photography. We learned the important aspects that make up a well composed photo. We learned the different aspects that go into producing and shooting a video as well as editing. Lastly, we learned about the html coding language.</p>
  <h2>My Teacher's Bio</h2>
  <p>As listed on Virginia Tech's website, Dr. Evia's expertise is in Technical and Professional Communication, User Assistance, Structured Authoring, Content Strategy and Workplace Safety Communication. His honors and awards as well as his research and published works reflect his expertise.</p>
  <h2>My Opinion</h2>
  <p>Overall, I've enjoyed this class. It has allowed me to get my feet wet in multiple aspects of media. The skills I learned in this class provide a solid foundation of knowledge and experience that will help me learn on the job or learn in a much quicker fashion in general in the future.</p>
  <p>My favorite project was the magazine layout project. I enjoyed learning more about Blacksburg and getting to write a brief story about Sugar Magnolia. In terms of the project I learned the most after completing it, I would either have to say the video project or the html projects. During the video project, I learned a lot about video editing in Adobe Cloud's Premeire which was something I did not know how to do prior to the project. The same went for the html projects. I was always intimidated by coding until I was introduced to the html projects in this class.</p>
